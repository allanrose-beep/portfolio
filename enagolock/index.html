      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>In 2023, a senior editor at Enago highlighted a recurring problem: high-value manuscripts sometimes included sensitive personal data like patient info, grant IDs, or unpublished results.</p>
      <p>As remote work grew, authors became hesitant to share documents involving grants or sensitive data. Without in-person safeguards, universities worried about editorial mishandling, threatening the traditional editing model.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 2rem; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
        I collaborated with editors, clients, and tech teams to assess the issue, spoke with users, mapped workflows, and found that insecure data handling was eroding author trust in traditional editing.

        I analyzed submission volumes and workflows to identify leak points. Using data and patterns, I demonstrated to leadership that this was a product issue, not just an operational hiccup.

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>Authors grew hesitant to share documents involving grants, IP, or sensitive data. Without in-person safeguards, universities feared editorial mishandling, weakening the traditional model.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 2rem; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
        The challenge was balancing editors’ need for simplicity and speed with universities’ demand for enterprise-grade security. My role was to design a solution that met both without slowing the process.

        <h2>Solution: Patch to Platform</h2>
        <p>At the time, Enago’s tech team had a small internal tool, nothing fancy, just a basic encrypt-decrypt utility to obscure author names and emails for internal transfers. It worked, but it was clearly duct tape over a growing leak.</p>
        <p><strong>Here’s what we did:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>We Created a risk map of the editing workflow with the tech team.</li>
          <li>We laid out key requirements like access control, time limits, and audit logs.</li>
          <li>Suggesting the .enago file extension as a visible marker so users could see their files were protected.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>How it Works</h2>
         <ul>
          <li>Authors upload files via the Inquiry form.</li>
          <li>Enago encrypts the document into a .enago file</li>
          <li>The file is viewable only through secure preview.</li>
          <li>Editors can only access files with time-bound keys</li>
          <li>Admins (authors) receive full access logs and traceability.</li>
         </ul>
      <p style="margin-top: 2rem; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
        I mapped the full user journey and worked with engineering to ensure the system was both secure and user-friendly. Security couldn’t feel like extra work, it had to be seamlessly integrated into the existing workflow.

      I helped launch Enago Lock and got university clients on board. By positioning it as both a unique feature and a way to build trust, I helped keep clients happy and grow our relationships.
