      <h2>TIntroduction: The Problem We Uncovered</h2>
      <p>We had a long-standing contract with a major university, funded by a large government research budget. The agreement allowed each of their 800 researchers to submit up to 10 documents for free editing, totaling 8000 documents. However, our system lacked real-time tracking, creating a critical blind spot. Authors sometimes submitted 12 to 15 documents unknowingly. This wasn’t just a billing issue; the client expected us to control submissions. Meanwhile, competitors were already targeting them with solutions that solved this problem.</p>

      <h2>The Real Cost of No Tracking</h2>
      <p>Our submission process for the SPOC Approval Model was missing a crucial piece: a real-time tracking system. As a result, it was far too easy for researchers to exceed their document limits, which led to a few significant headaches:</p>

    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <p>We quickly realized that trying to track assignments once they were in the system was a losing battle. The university's confirmation process was often delayed, and with a backlog of authors, the SPOC would sometimes confirm orders randomly, without any count.</p>
    <p>Our "aha!" moment was deciding to halt the process at the inquiry stage itself, right on the form. This meant that when an author entered their email, the system would recognize them and give them a choice: they could either submit their inquiry through the university-funded account or through their own personal account, for which they would pay upfront.</p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>We decided to solve this by adding a smart check directly on the NEIP form. When a researcher entered their email, the system instantly checked their submission count. Based on that, they were given two clear options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Group ID: The university-funded account, if they still had submissions left.</li>
          <li>Individual Account: Their personal account, where they would pay upfront.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This approach gave us a clear competitive advantage. We didn't just have a tracker; we had a live inquiry restrictor on the form itself. This gave us more control and provided a much better user experience.</p>

    <h2>The Outcome</h2>
    <p>We built a new database table to track limits, and we updated the inquiry form so the account selection pop-up showed a live count. Once the limit was hit, the Group ID option was greyed out. Our successful pilot launched with the university’s clients, and it worked perfectly. This feature was not built for our legacy submission form and did not change the core SPOC Approval Model workflow.</p>
