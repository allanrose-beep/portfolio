      <h2>The Investigation</h2>
      <p>We pulled data from CRM logs, listened in on CS calls, and sat down with the CS reps. Turns out, each CS agent was going in blind, with no memory of the client's earlier interactions, service preferences, or previous follow-ups. Every call felt like starting from scratch. And in a world of impatient users, that was costing us.</p>

      <h2>The Core Insight</h2>
      <p>Our customer service team was working hard, but they lacked the critical information needed to make meaningful connections with potential clients. Without visibility into previous interactions, they couldn't demonstrate that we valued the relationship.</p>
      <p>This gap created a jarring experience for customers who expected continuity but instead encountered what felt like amnesia with each new interaction..</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A clean, scrollable view per lead</li>
          <li>All info in one place: service requested, location, form data</li>
          <li>Outcome tagging</li>
          <li>Optional notes to log edge cases (language barrier, urgency, etc.) <br>These notes would later on be used as data to create more logic and make this Tool smarter</li>
